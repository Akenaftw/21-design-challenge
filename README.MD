Extra assignment CSS styling 0/22

goal: making a pixel perfect replica of a png file without any descriptions of steps.

update log:
push 1: Made the first part of the html file, added a lot of functions to
the text bars to make it function like an actual form would instead of just
focussing on the styling. I learned a lot about text input boxes and option boxes.
I also read up a bit on how this will connect to php later on already linking the id's
looking forward to playing around with this later on in the course.

push 2: Finished the html file finally . struggled a bit with the ids from the
split up phone number boxes, decided to live with the error and never to split these
boxes up when I am making a form for an assignment. 
Now looking to start the css side of the assignment, seems like a big challenge so
looking forward to fixing it up just right.
