Extra assignment CSS styling 0/22

Just done the first part of the html, trying to make a functioning web page
by just using html and css. 

update log:
first push: Made the first part of the html file, added a lot of functions to
the text bars to make it function like an actual form would instead of just
focussing on the styling. I learned a lot about text input boxes and option boxes.
I also read up a bit on how this will connect to php later on already linking the id's
looking forward to playing around with this later on in the course.
